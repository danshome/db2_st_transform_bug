# DB2 ST_Transform Bug Reproduction

This repository contains a self-contained harness that launches the IBM DB2 Community Edition container, spatially enables the bundled SAMPLE database, and runs a multithreaded Python workload that repeatedly executes the problematic `ST_Transform` query until DB2 fails.

## Prerequisites

- Docker CLI with access to pull `icr.io/db2_community/db2`
  - On macOS, ensure Docker Desktop supports `linux/amd64`; the harness will automatically set the platform flag.
- Python 3.9+ and `make`

## Quick Start

```bash
make test
```

The `test` target will

1. Provision a virtual environment and install `ibm-db`.
2. Start a fresh DB2 container (`db2-st-transform`) with the SAMPLE database.
3. Install the spatial extensions on SAMPLE.
4. Launch the threaded query hammer.

The hammer runs for 5 minutes by default. If no failure is observed, re-run with a larger duration or let it run indefinitely:

```bash
make test ARGS="--duration 0"
```

## Useful Options

You can pass additional arguments to the harness via the `ARGS` variable:

```bash
make test ARGS="--threads 16 --pool-size 24 --log-level DEBUG"
```

Run `python -m scripts.repro_runner --help` for the full list of supported options, including overriding the image tag, reusing an existing container, and keeping the container alive for post-mortem inspection.

## Target SQL

The workload repeatedly issues the following statement (see `scripts/repro_runner.py:11`):

```sql
SELECT CASE
           WHEN DB2GSE.ST_IsEmpty(DB2GSE.ST_Point(CAST(-98.71447796 AS DOUBLE),
                                                  CAST(29.48604692 AS DOUBLE), CAST(4269 AS INTEGER)))=1
                OR DB2GSE.ST_IsValid(DB2GSE.ST_Point(CAST(-98.71447796 AS DOUBLE),
                                                     CAST(29.48604692 AS DOUBLE), CAST(4269 AS INTEGER)))=0
           THEN NULL
           ELSE CAST(db2gse.ST_AsText(db2gse.ST_Transform(DB2GSE.ST_Point(CAST(-98.71447796 AS DOUBLE),
                                                                          CAST(29.48604692 AS DOUBLE), CAST(4269 AS INTEGER)), CAST(4326 AS INTEGER))) AS CLOB(2097152))
      END
FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1
```

The query validates a single NAD83 point and transforms it into WGS84 (`ST_Transform(..., 4326)`), returning the result as WKT. When this runs concurrently across many connections, DB2â€™s spatial extender intermittently hits the `sqlzAssertFailed` path captured in the diagnostic log.

## Reproducing And Confirming The Bug

1. Start the test harness (runs for five minutes by default):
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
   The container init phase takes several minutes while DB2 creates the SAMPLE database and the harness spatially enables it using `db2se enable_db SAMPLE`.

2. Watch the DB2 diagnostic output in real time:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f db2-st-transform
   ```

3. A successful reproduction emits a non-fatal assertion followed by an `ADM14005E` message similar to:
   ```
   2025-10-14-23.25.10.086038+000 I363420E1996          LEVEL: Severe
   PID     : 52263                TID : 46913160209984  PROC : db2sysc 0
   INSTANCE: db2inst1             NODE : 000            DB   : SAMPLE

   NON-FATAL ASSERTION FAILED!!!
   ASSERTION EXPRESSION: Invalid pad type (0x2AAC) found at:

   ...
   ADM14005E  The following error occurred: "AppErr".  First Occurrence Data Capture (FODC) has been invoked in the following mode: "Automatic".
   ```
   The same details are stored inside the container at `/database/config/db2inst1/sqllib/db2dump/db2diag.log` and the corresponding FODC directory (for example, `.../FODC_AppErr_2025-10-14-23.25.11.895779_52263_22_000/`).

4. When allowing the harness to run indefinitely (`make test ARGS="--duration 0"`), restart DB2 after the crash or re-run `make test` (the harness tears down the container automatically).

## Cleanup

```bash
make container-stop   # stop and remove just the container
make clean            # remove the container and the virtual environment
```
